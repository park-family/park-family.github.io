## Abstract
Carrier-depletion monolithic III-V/Si optical phase modulators are proposed and numerically investigated. Thanks to the larger carrier-induced refractive index change of the III-Vs compared to Si, the III-V/Si phase modulator is predicted to achieve 0.07-Vcm modulation efficiency at 16-dB/cm optical loss at 1310-nm wavelengths.
