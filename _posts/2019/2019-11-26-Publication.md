## Abstract
The influence of high-power laser diode (HPLD) emitter width on the device performance is investigated for 975-nm (In,Ga)(As,P)/(Al,Ga)As broad-area HPLDs, using self-consistent electro-thermal-optical simulation. To guarantee the simulation's accuracy, simulated results are matched with the measured results for a sample HPLD with fitting parameters. The influences of HPLD emitter width on temperature distribution, output power, and the beam product parameter (BPP) are analyzed for three different emitter widths of 50, 70, and 
90Î¼m. It is found that a device with smaller emitter width exhibits both thermal rollover and thermal blooming at lower output power, but smaller BPP.
