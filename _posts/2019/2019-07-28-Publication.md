## Abstract
We propose a novel heat-sinking structure for a high-power broad-area laser diode. 
In our laser diode, the pedestal structure is introduced to both top and bottom sides of the laser diode so that the heat generated within the device can be more efficiently released. 
The characteristics of high-power broad-area laser diodes containing the double pedestal structure are numerically analyzed by self-consistent electro-thermal-optical simulation. It is demonstrated that our laser diode has narrower lateral far-field angle and lower active region temperature compared to previously reported high-power laser diode structures.
