## Analysis and modeling on propagation loss of III-V/Si waveguide 
III-V materials had been traditionally considered one of the most promising materials for semiconductor photonic devices, and it has been introduced in Si photonics to breakthrough the limited device performances due to Si's poor optical properties. We have proposed and demonstrated a monolithic III-V/Si phase modulator. This work aims to understand the behaviour of propagation loss of III-V/Si waveguide, which is one of the most important performances for low optical link budget.

## Simulation and design for III-V/Si SIS*-type optical modulator using nano-ridge engineering
Nano-ridge engineering is one of the most promising methods to achieve a high crystal quality of III-V on a Si platform. Since the high crystal quality is also important for optical phase modulators to reduce loss and improve modulation efficiency, we have proposed a III-V/Si SIS-type optical modulator using nano-ridge engineering. This work aims to expect performance enhancement and optimize device performance using TCAD simulations.

## Si VOA* modeling for PDK development 
Si VOA is one of the essential building blocks in a Si photonics platform in order to control optical power level in a chip. This work aims to analyze device performance by means of experiment and TCAD simulation, and provide the compact model of Si VOA for PDK development.
